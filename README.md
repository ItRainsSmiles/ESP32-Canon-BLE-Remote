[![Bluetooth Remote for Modern Canon Cameras](./.github/cover.png)](https://youtu.be/Gh5uEc2dNJM "BR-M5 | Open-Source Bluetooth Remote for Canon DSLRs")

# Canon BLE Remote 
This Bluetooth remote library aims to replicate Canon's BR-E1 bluetooth remote behavior since modern Canon Cameras doesn't have wired shutter trigger port anymore. Ex. EOS M50, EOS R, EOS EP
This library is adapted and inspired from [BR-M5](https://github.com/ArthurFDLR/BR-M5)

## Features
* Single firing and focus commands.
* Pair and remember. (Paring is only required for initial connection)
* Auto re-connect.

## Installation
- Platform IO Library Manager
- Arduino IDE Library Manager
- Manual installation by copying this repository to your `library` folder

## Usage
I'm highly reccommended to checkout example code to see how to use it.

1.  On camera, go to Wireless Communication Settings > Bluetooth Function > set bluetooth function to Remote. Clear all existing connection (if necesary) and press Pairing.
2.  Call `pair()` function. If you're trying this sample code, press shutter button while booting ESP32 to enter pairing mode.
3.  For picture mode, enable remote shutter in drive mode menu (Self-timer:10s/Remote). For video mode, press menu button and enable remote control.

If paring doesnâ€™t work, clear all existing connection, power off and re-insert battery (necessary), then try again. 

## Tested device(s)
- Canon EOS M50 (EOS Kiss M)
(Feel free to help me confirm with other cameras, but technically, it should works)

## To-do
- [ ] Add support for W/T buttons.
- [ ] Optimize and cleanup code.

Feel free to contribute!
